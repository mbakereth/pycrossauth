# Crossauth.js

Crossauth is a package for authentication and authorization using username/password, LDAP and OAuth2.  It has two components, each can be used without the other: server for the backend and client for the frontend.  There is also a Typescript package (in a separate repository) that provides identical functionality, plus frontend Javascript..
